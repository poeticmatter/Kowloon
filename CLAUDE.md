# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run lint       # TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)
npm test           # vitest
npm run build      # production build
npm run deploy     # build and publish to GitHub Pages
npm run init-game -- <repo-name> <game-id> "<Title>"   # one-time rename of a fresh template copy
```

## Architecture

A browser game for 2–5 players taking turns in order, with no backend of its own. It is part of the game lab (poeticmatter/game-lab); each game lives in its own repo created from poeticmatter/game-template-turns. (Two-player games where both choose at the same time start from poeticmatter/game-template instead.)

The multiplayer platform (lobby, seats, transports, status screens) is **GameKit**'s `game-kit/turns`, a package pinned in `package.json` to a release tag of poeticmatter/GameKit (local copy: `C:\Code\GameKit`).

- `src/game/`: the game. Pure rules (`rules.ts`, tested in `rules.test.ts`), React UI (`Board.tsx`, `SettingsForm.tsx`), seat colours, and `index.ts` exporting `game: GameModule`. The example is Pig.
- `src/game.config.ts`: `GAME_CONFIG`: the game id, title, tagline, and Supabase settings read from `.env.local`.
- `src/App.tsx`: renders `<TurnBasedGameApp config={GAME_CONFIG} game={game} />`. GameKit routes on the URL (`?room=CODE[&mode=async]`); hot-seat matches have no URL.
- `src/index.css`: Tailwind, GameKit's theme (`game-kit/theme.css`), and any colour token overrides.

### Rules contract

- `createInitialState({ settings, playerCount, seed })` and `applyMove(state, move)` must be pure and deterministic. Keep randomness in the game state, seeded from `seed`, and draw with GameKit's `nextIndex` / `nextRandom`, so every client gets the same results.
- `activePlayer(state)` names the seat whose move the game awaits (null once over). A turn may take several moves; GameKit only applies moves from the active player.
- `applyMove` throws GameKit's `IllegalMoveError` for a move that breaks the rules; GameKit catches it and leaves the state alone.

### Seats and transports (in GameKit)

- Seats fill in join order; the creator is seat 0. Browsers remember their seat per room; anyone with the link can take back a seat ("That's me") or watch.
- **Async (Supabase)**: one row per room in `<game-id>_games` (`players`, `player_count`, `state`, `version`), with seats claimed through `<game-id>_claim_seat`. Both are defined in `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Live (PeerJS)**: the creator hosts and runs the rules; the game ends if the host closes the tab.
- **Hot seat**: one device; `role` is always the active player and the Board gets `seating: 'hot_seat'`.

## Rules

- All state changes go through `rules.applyMove`. UI components only render state and submit moves.
- Keep `GAME_CONFIG.id` and the table and function names in `supabase/migrations/` in sync.
- To change platform behaviour, change GameKit, tag a release, and bump the `game-kit` version in `package.json`. Don't patch `node_modules/game-kit`.
